# Python OAuth Sample

Once you've downloaded `oauth.py` simply compile it and run it:

```
python
>>> import oauth
```

When it runs, it will prompt you in the the command line to copy and paste a url into a browser, do that, authorize your app and paste the code from the address bar back into the command and press enter.

# Go OAuth Sample

This sample makes use of environment variables, please make sure you have variables configured for `twist_clientID` and `twist_clientSecret` for this to work.

Once you've downloaded the sample folder simply run it:

```
go run .
```

When it runs, it will prompt you in the the command line to copy and paste a url into a browser, do that, authorize your app and paste the code from the address bar back into the command and press enter.
